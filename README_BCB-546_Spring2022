This repository contains three file folders. These are:

-Code Directory

-Data Directory

-Results Directory


--Code Directory

This directory contains all of the code used to complete this project. It contains an R markdown file (arthropod_markdown.Rmd), a knit github markdown document for our R code (arthropod_markdown.md), a jupytr notebook (arthropod_python.ipynb), a copy of the data file used to run the code (DS-KROK4BDJ.txt) and the output files of the python script (bug_tree.nex, bug_tree.xml). 

--Data Directory

This directory contains the article we chose ("BDJ_article_77661.pdf"), and the tsv and csv files containing data,  provided by the authors.  "DS-KROK4BDJ.txt"  contains all the data combined that we used for our phylogenetic tree construction.

--Results Directory

This directory contains the output and results files for our codes. It contains a copy of our fasta file which was created by the R script, along with a .nwd file of our phylogenetic tree (tree.nwk).
