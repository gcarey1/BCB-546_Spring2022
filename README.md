<br />This repository contains three file folders. These are:
<br />
<br />-Code Directory

<br />
<br />--Code Directory
<br />
<br />This directory contains all of the code used to complete this project. 
<br />It contains an R markdown file (arthropod_markdown.Rmd), a knit github markdown document for our R code (arthropod_markdown.md), 
a jupytr notebook (arthropod_python.ipynb), a copy of the data file used to run the code (DS-KROK4BDJ.txt) 
and the output files of the python script (bug_tree.nex, bug_tree.xml). 
<br />
<br />--Data Directory
<br />
<br />This directory contains the article we chose ("BDJ_article_77661.pdf"), and the tsv and csv files containing data,  provided by the authors.  
"DS-KROK4BDJ.txt"  contains all the data combined that we used for our phylogenetic tree construction.
<br />
<br />--Results Directory
<br />
<br />This directory contains the output and results files for our codes. 
<br />It contains a copy of our fasta file which was created by the R script, along with a .nwd file of our phylogenetic tree (tree.nwk). 
<br />
